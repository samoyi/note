## 思想
1. We like using program elements to add structure — providing opportunities for variation, reuse, or just having more helpful names. 
2. But sometimes the structure isn’t needed. It may be a function that’s named the same as its body code reads, or a class that is essentially one simple function. 
3. Sometimes, this reflects a function that was expected to grow and be popular later, but never realized its dreams. Sometimes, it’s a class that used to pay its way, but has been downsized with refactoring. 
4. Either way, such program elements need to die with dignity.
