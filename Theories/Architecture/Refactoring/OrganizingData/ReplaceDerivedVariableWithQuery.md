## 思想


## Motivation
### 变动意味着引入不确定性，能不变动就不变动
1. One of the biggest sources of problems in software is mutable data. Data changes can often couple together parts of code in awkward ways, with changes in one part leading to knock­on effects that are hard to spot. 
2. In many situations it’s not realistic to entirely remove mutable data — but I do advocate minimizing the scope of mutable data at much as possible. 

TODO 后面不懂，看起来也没有减少变化
