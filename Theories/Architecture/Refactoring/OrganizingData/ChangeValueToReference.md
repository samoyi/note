## 思想
和 Change Reference to Value 相反


## Motivation


## Mechanics
1. Changing a value to a reference results in only one object being present for an entity, and it usually means I need some kind of repository where I can access these objects. I then only create the object for an entity once, and everywhere else I retrieve it from the repository.
