## 思想
归类，收纳，美学。


## Motivation
1. Code is easier to understand when things that are related to each other appear together. 
2. If several lines of code access the same data structure, it’s best for them to be together rather than intermingled with code accessing other data structures.
3. Putting related code into a clearly separated function is a better separation than just moving a set of lines together, but I can’t do the Extract Function unless the code is together in the first place.
