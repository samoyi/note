# 3. Virtual DOM
Through a Vue instance, an HTML component is converted to a virtual DOM object.

***
## Computed Properties
1. A computed property function is actually the getter function of this property
   in the virtual DOM object.
2. Computed properties are cached based on their dependencies. The reason is,
   property accessing should have been a quick opetation, but using getter
   function, it becomes slower, especially the function has a lot of
   computations. If this property is depended in other places, then each time
   access this property, its getter function will be invoked.

## HTML reuse
Vue tries to render elements as efficiently as possible, often re-using them instead of rendering from scratch.
### The `key` attribute
* [`key` in conditional rendering](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/conditional.html#Controlling-Reusable-Elements-with-key)
* [`key` in list rendering](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/list.html#key)

### Replacing an array will not cause re-rendering
