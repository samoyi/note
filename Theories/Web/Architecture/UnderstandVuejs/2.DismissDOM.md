# 2. DismissDOM
A website without using a framework like Vue or React


***
## DOM is a bad translator
1. HTML and JS can not communicate with each other directly, they need DOM.
2. DOM, a model of HTML document, is more complicated and more abstract than
   HTML itself.
3. HTML document is a structure which is logical and well-organized. The use of
   DOM will, undoubtedly, undermine the logic and organization and add extra
   code.
4. DOM operation is very inefficent


***
## Communicate with HTML document directly
1. By a Vue instance, the data in JS is bound to HTML directly. When the data in
   JS changed, the HTML changed.
2. No complicated and abstract DOM, just logical and well-organized HTML.
3. A Vue instance corresponds to an HTML component.
4. Under the hood, Vue compiles the templates into Virtual DOM render functions.
Combined with the reactivity system, Vue is able to intelligently figure out the
minimal amount of components to re-render and apply the minimal amount of DOM
manipulations when the app state changes.
5. Use event handling of Vue, without DOM, the event triggered on HTML node will
   be passed to corresponded Vue instance in JS.


***
## Advantages of VUE rendering
1. Removing the abstraction of DOM
2. Using virtural DOM instead of real DOM
