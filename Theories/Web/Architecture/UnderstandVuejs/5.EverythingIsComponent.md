# 5. Everything is component

## `<template>`
Use `<template>` to package any number of HTML tags as a single component, which
can be controlled by its Vue instance.


***
## *functional* component -- decoupled
Just like function in functional programming, every component instance has its
own isolated scope:
* Unless a component exposes a specific prop explicitly, it will not be affected
by external environment.
* A component can not derectly change the external environment, it can only
throw a event which exteranl environment may receive.
* However, if the `prop` that is passed is a reference type, the value passed
in fact is a pointer instead of the real value pointed by the pointer. So if the
 `prop` is assigned to a variable `var` inside the child component, the
corresponding property outside the component is also modified when modifying the
 `var`'s property in child component. 
* Reusable components should define a clean public interface and make no
assumptions about the context itâ€™s used in.
* The API for a Vue component comes in three parts: props, events, and slots
    * Props allow the external environment to pass data into the component
    * Events allow the component to trigger side effects in the external
      environment
    * Slots allow the external environment to compose the component with extra
      content
