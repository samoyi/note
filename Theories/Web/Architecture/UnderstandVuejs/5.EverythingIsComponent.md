# 5. Everything is component

## `<template>`
Use `<template>` to package any number of HTML tags as a single component, which
can be controlled by its Vue instance.


***
## *functional* component
Just like function in functional programming, every component instance has its
own isolated scope:
* Unless a component exposes a specific prop explicitly, it will not be affected
by external environment.
* A component can not derectly change the external environment, it can only
throw a evnet which exteranl environment may receive.
