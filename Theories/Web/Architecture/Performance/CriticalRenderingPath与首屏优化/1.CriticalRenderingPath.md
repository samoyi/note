## Summary
1. How exactly does the browser go from consuming our HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to rendered pixels on the screen?  
2. Optimizing for performance is all about understanding what happens in these intermediate steps between receiving the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript bytes and the required processing to turn them into rendered pixels - that's the **critical rendering path**.
3. By optimizing the critical rendering path we can significantly improve the time to first render of our pages. 
4. Further, understanding the critical rendering path also serves as a foundation for building well-performing interactive applications. The interactive updates process is the same, just done in a continuous loop and ideally at 60 frames per second.

## 步骤目录
Here's a quick recap of the browser's steps:
1. Process HTML markup and build the DOM tree.
2. Process CSS markup and build the CSSOM tree.
3. Combine the DOM and CSSOM into a render tree.
4. Run layout on the render tree to compute geometry of each node.
5. Paint the individual nodes to the screen.


## Constructing the Object Model

Before the browser can render the page, it needs to construct the DOM and CSSOM trees. As a result, we need to ensure that we deliver both the HTML and CSS to the browser as quickly as possible.  

### TL;DR
* Bytes → characters → tokens → nodes → object model.
* HTML markup is transformed into a Document Object Model (DOM); CSS markup is transformed into a CSS Object Model (CSSOM).
* DOM and CSSOM are independent data structures.

### Document Object Model (DOM)

1. **Conversion**: The browser reads the raw bytes of HTML off the disk or network, and translates them to individual characters based on specified encoding of the file (for example, UTF-8).
2. **Tokenizing**: The browser converts strings of characters into distinct tokens—as specified by the [W3C HTML5 standard](https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/); for example, "<html>", "<body>"—and other strings within angle brackets. Each token has a special meaning and its own set of rules.
3. **Lexing**: The emitted tokens are converted into "objects," which define their properties and rules.
4. **DOM construction**: Finally, because the HTML markup defines relationships between different tags (some tags are contained within other tags) the created objects are linked in a tree data structure that also captures the parent-child relationships defined in the original markup: the HTML object is a parent of the body object, the body is a parent of the paragraph object, and so on.
5. The final output of this entire process is the Document Object Model (DOM), which the browser uses for all further processing of the page.

### CSS Object Model (CSSOM)

#### Why does the CSSOM have a tree structure?
When computing the final set of styles for any object on the page, the browser starts with the most general rule applicable to that node (for example, if it is a child of a body element, then all body styles apply) and then recursively refines the computed styles by applying more specific rules; that is, the rules "cascade down."


## Render-tree Construction, Layout, and Paint
* 可以直接看 [Google developers 的文章](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance/critical-rendering-path/render-tree-construction)

* The CSSOM and DOM trees are combined into a render tree, which is then used to compute the layout of each visible element and serves as an input to the paint process that renders the pixels to screen. Optimizing each of these steps is critical to achieving optimal rendering performance.
* The time required to perform render tree construction, layout and paint varies based on the size of the document, the applied styles, and the device it is running on: the larger the document, the more work the browser has; the more complicated the styles, the more time taken for painting also (for example, a solid color is "cheap" to paint, while a drop shadow is "expensive" to compute and render).

### TL;DR
* The DOM and CSSOM trees are combined to form the render tree.
* Render tree contains only the nodes required to render the page.
* Layout computes the exact position and size of each object.
* The last step is paint, which takes in the final render tree and renders the pixels to the screen

### Form the render tree
First, the browser combines the DOM and CSSOM into a "render tree," which captures all the visible DOM content on the page and all the CSSOM style information for each node.

To construct the render tree, the browser roughly does the following:
1. Starting at the root of the DOM tree, traverse each visible node.
    * Some nodes are not visible (for example, script tags, meta tags, and so on), and are omitted since they are not reflected in the rendered output.
    * Some nodes are hidden via CSS and are also omitted from the render tree.
2. For each visible node, find the appropriate matching CSSOM rules and apply them.
3. Emit visible nodes with content and their computed styles. The final output is a render that contains both the content and style information of all the visible content on the screen.

### Layout
1. Up to this point we've calculated which nodes should be visible and their computed styles, but we have not calculated their exact position and size within the viewport of the device---that's the "layout" stage, also known as "reflow".
2. To figure out the exact size and position of each object on the page, the browser begins at the root of the render tree and traverses it.
3. The output of the layout process is a "box model," which precisely captures the exact position and size of each element within the viewport: all of the relative measurements are converted to absolute pixels on the screen.

### Paint
Finally, now that we know which nodes are visible, and their computed styles and geometry, we can pass this information to the final stage, which converts each node in the render tree to actual pixels on the screen. This step is often referred to as "painting" or "rasterizing."
