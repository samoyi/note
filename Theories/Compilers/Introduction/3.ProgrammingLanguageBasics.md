## The Static/Dynamic Distinction
1. Among the most important issues that we face when designing a compiler for a language is what decisions can the compiler make about a program.
2. If a language uses a policy that allows the compiler to decide an issue, then we say that the language uses a *static* policy or that the issue can be decided at *compile time*. 
3. On the other hand, a policy that only allows a decision to be made when we execute the program is said to be a *dynamic* policy or to require a decision at *run time*.

### Scope
1. One issue on which we shall concentrate is the scope of declarations. The *scope* of a declaration of `x` is the region of the program in which uses of `x` refer to this declaration. 
2. A language uses *static scope* or *lexical scope* if it is possible to determine the scope of a declaration by looking only at the program. 
3. Otherwise, the language uses *dynamic scope*. With dynamic scope, as the program runs, the same use of `x` could refer to any of several diﬀerent declarations of `x`. 
4. Most languages, such as C and Java, use static scope.

## Static Scope and Block Structure


## Explicit Access Control
Through the use of keywords like `public`, `private`, and `protected`, object-oriented languages such as C++ or Java provide explicit control over access to member names in a superclass.


## Dynamic Scope


## Parameter Passing Mechanisms
