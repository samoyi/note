## The Static/Dynamic Distinction
1. Among the most important issues that we face when designing a compiler for a language is what decisions can the compiler make about a program.
2. If a language uses a policy that allows the compiler to decide an issue, then we say that the language uses a **static** policy or that the issue can be decided at **compile time**. 
3. On the other hand, a policy that only allows a decision to be made when we execute the program is said to be a **dynamic** policy or to require a decision at **run time**.


## Scope
1. One issue on which we shall concentrate is the scope of declarations. The **scope** of a declaration of `x` is the region of the program in which uses of `x` refer to this declaration. 
2. 如果通过阅读程序源代码就能确定一个声明的作用域，那这个语言使用的就是 **静态作用域**（static scope），也称为 **词法作用域**（lexical scope）。
3. 而如果只有到了运行时才能确定作用域，那这个语言使用的就是 **动态作用域**（dynamic scope）。 With dynamic scope, as the program runs, the same use of `x` could refer to any of several diﬀerent declarations of `x`. 
4. Most languages, such as C and Java, use static scope.

## Explicit Access Control
Through the use of keywords like `public`, `private`, and `protected`, object-oriented languages such as C++ or Java provide explicit control over access to member names in a superclass.


## Dynamic Scope
