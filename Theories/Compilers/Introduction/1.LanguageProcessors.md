## 设计思想
### 编译器和解释器的两种高效率理念


## 编译器（compiler）和解释器（interpreter）
1. Simply stated, a compiler is a program that can read a program in one language - the *source* language - and translate it into an equivalent program in another language - the *target* language
    <img src="./images/01.png" width="200" style="display: block; margin: 5px 0 10px;" />
2. An important role of the compiler is to report any errors in the source program that it detects during the translation process.
3. If the target program is an executable machine-language program, it can then be called by the user to process inputs and produce outputs
    <img src="./images/02.png" width="400" style="display: block; margin: 5px 0 10px;" />
4. An interpreter is another common kind of language processor. Instead of producing a target program as a translation, an interpreter appears to directly execute the operations specifed in the source program on inputs supplied by the user
    <img src="./images/03.png" width="400" style="display: block; margin: 5px 0 10px;" />
5. The machine-language target program produced by a compiler is usually much faster than an interpreter at mapping inputs to outputs. 
6. An interpreter, however, can usually give better error diagnostics than a compiler, because it
executes the source program statement by statement.
7. 程序的执行就是接收输入并产出输出。编译器是先处理好源程序再执行程序，解释器是一边处理源程序一边执行。

### 混合编译器（Hybrid compiler）
1. As an example, Java language processors combine compilation and interpretation. 
    <img src="./images/04.png" width="400" style="display: block; margin: 5px 0 10px;" />
2. A Java source program may frst be compiled into an intermediate form called *bytecodes*. The bytecodes are then interpreted by a virtual machine. 
3. 这里的混合，也就是说编译只编译到字节码而不是机器码，然后使用虚拟机直接解释执行字节码。
4. A beneft of this arrangement is that bytecodes compiled on one machine can be interpreted on another machine, perhaps across a network.
4. In order to achieve faster processing of inputs to outputs, some Java compilers, called *just-in-time* compilers, translate the bytecodes into machine language immediately before they run the intermediate program to process the input. 依然不是解释执行，还是即使的编译成机器码。


## 其他需要的处理程序
1. In addition to a compiler, several other programs may be required to create an executable target program. 包括预处理器（preprocessor）、 汇编器（assembler）、链接器（linker）和加载器（loader）
    <img src="./images/05.png" width="400" style="display: block; margin: 5px 0 10px;" />
2. A source program may be divided into modules stored in separate fles. The task of collecting the source program is sometimes entrusted to a separate program, called a *preprocessor*.
3. The preprocessor may also expand shorthands, called macros, into source language statements.
4. The modifed source program is then fed to a compiler. The compiler may produce an assembly-language program as its output, because assembly language is easier to produce as output and is easier to debug. 
5. The assembly language is then processed by a program called an *assembler* that produces relocatable machine code as its output.
6. Large programs are often compiled in pieces, so the relocatable machine code may have to be linked together with other relocatable object files and library files into the code that actually runs on the machine. 
7. The *linker* resolves external memory addresses, where the code in one file may refer to a location in another file. 
8. The *loader* then puts together all of the executable object files into memory for execution.
