# Summary

## Overview
1. Operating systems provide various services to their users, including file
management, process management (running and terminating applications), batch
processing, and operating system monitoring and configuration.
2. A shell is a user interface for access to an operating system's services.
3. In general, operating system shells use either a command-line interface (CLI)
or graphical user interface (GUI), depending on a computer's role and particular
operation.
4. It is named a shell because it is a layer around the operating system kernel.
5. Most operating system shells are not direct interfaces to the underlying
kernel, shells are actually special applications that use the kernel API in just
the same way as it is used by other application programs.
6. A shell manages the user–system interaction by prompting users for input,
interpreting their input, and then handling an output from the underlying
operating system.
7. Since the operating system shell is actually an application, it may easily be
replaced with another similar application, for most operating systems.
8. Most operating system shells fall into one of two categories – command-line
and graphical. Command line shells provide a command-line interface (CLI) to the operating system, while graphical shells provide a graphical user interface
(GUI).
