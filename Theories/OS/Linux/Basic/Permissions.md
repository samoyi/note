# Permissions

## Permissions and people
### 3 things you may do with a file
* `r` read - you may view the contents of the file.
* `w` write - you may change the contents of the file.
* `x` execute - you may execute or run the file if it is a program or script.

### 3 sets of people
For every file we define 3 sets of people for whom we may specify permissions
* `owner` - a single person who owns the file. (typically the person who created
 the file but ownership may be granted to some one else by certain users)
* `group` - every file belongs to a single group.
* `others` - everyone else who is not in the group or the owner.
