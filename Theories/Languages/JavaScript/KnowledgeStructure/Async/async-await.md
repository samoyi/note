# async-await

## Basic
1. The `async` keyword before a function has two effects:
    1. Makes it always return a promise.
    2. Allows to use await in it.
2. If the code has `return <non-promise>` in it, then JavaScript automatically
wraps it into a resolved promise with that value.
3. The `await` keyword before a promise makes JavaScript wait until that promise
 settles, and then:
    1. If itâ€™s an error, the exception is generated, same as if `throw error`
    were called at that very place.
    2. Otherwise, it returns the result, so we can assign it to a value.
