# Evaluation Strategy

1. When a function is invoked, an activation record, otherwise known as an **execution context**, is created.
2. This record contains information about where the function was called from (the call-stack), how the function was invoked, what parameters were passed, etc.
3. One of the properties of this record is the `this` reference which will be used for the duration of that function's execution.
