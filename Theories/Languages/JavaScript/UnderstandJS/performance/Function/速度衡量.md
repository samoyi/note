# 速度衡量


## 函数本身以外影响速度的方面
* Time for the compiler to warm up (e.g. time to compile the code into byte code)。第一次执行要比之后执行慢。
* The main thread being busy doing other things we didn’t realize were going on
* Your computer’s CPU(s) being busy with something that slows down your whole browser
* 执行环境。一个查找字符的方法用在很短和很长的字符串是运行时间肯定会不同。
* 不同的引擎。


## 衡量方法
### `performance​.now()`
#### Precision
1. Unlike other timing data available to JavaScript (for example `Date.now`), the timestamps returned by `performance.now()` are not limited to one-millisecond resolution. Instead, they represent times as floating-point numbers with up to microsecond precision.
2. Also unlike `Date.now()`, the values returned by `performance.now()` always increase at a constant rate, independent of the system clock (which might be adjusted manually or skewed by software like NTP).

#### Reduced time precision
1. The timestamp is not actually high-resolution.
2. To mitigate security threats such as Spectre, browsers currently round the results to varying degrees. Firefox started rounding to 1 millisecond in Firefox 60.
3. Some browsers may also slightly randomize the timestamp.
4. The precision may improve again in future releases; browser developers are still investigating these timing attacks and how best to mitigate them.

#### Web Worker 中的情况
* In dedicated workers created from a `Window` context, the value in the worker will be lower than `performance.now()` in the window who spawned that worker. It used to be the same as `t0` of the main context, but this was changed.
* In shared or service workers, the value in the worker might be higher than that of the main context because that window can be created after those workers.

#### `performance​.now()`使用时要注意的
##### 单次结果并不稳定
1. The execution time greatly depends on various factors:
    * Time for the compiler to warm up (e.g. time to compile the code into byte code)
    * The main thread being busy doing other things we didn’t realize were going on
    * Your computer’s CPU(s) being busy with something that slows down your whole browser
2. 这也会导致第一次的执行时间会明显多于之后的执行时间。
    ```js
    function makeHash(source) {
        var hash = 0;
        if (source.length === 0) {
            debugger;
            return hash;
        };
        for (var i = 0; i < source.length; i++) {
            var char = source.charCodeAt(i);
            hash = ((hash<<5)-hash)+char;
            hash = hash & hash; // Convert to 32bit integer
        }
        return hash;
    }

    for (let i=0; i<10; i++) {
        var t0 = performance.now();
        var result = makeHash('Peter');
        var t1 = performance.now();
        console.log('Took', (t1 - t0).toFixed(4), 'milliseconds to generate:', result);
    }
    ```

##### 浏览器很可能会进行缓存
1. 反复调用函数时，如果每次都是相同的输入，则浏览器很可能会直接返回缓存的结果
    ```js
    var numbers = [];
    for (var i=0; i < 10; i++) {
        var t0 = performance.now();
        makeHash('Peter');
        var t1 = performance.now();
        numbers.push(t1 - t0);
    }
    console.log(numbers); // 比如 [0.054999953135848045, 0, 0.004999921657145023, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0.00500003807246685]
    ```
2. 可以首先过滤掉值为`0`的结果以及第一次的结果。然后或者计算平均值，或者取中位值。下面[引用的文章](https://www.sitepoint.com/measuring-javascript-functions-performance/)中说中位值更好，不知道为什么。
    ```js
    var numbers = [];
    for (var i=0; i < 30; i++) {
        var t0 = performance.now();
        makeHash('Peter');
        var t1 = performance.now();
        if (t1 - t0) {
            numbers.push(t1 - t0);
        }
    }
    function median(sequence) {
        numbers.sort();
        return numbers[Math.ceil(sequence.length / 2)];
    }
    console.log('Median time', median(numbers).toFixed(4), 'milliseconds');
    ```
