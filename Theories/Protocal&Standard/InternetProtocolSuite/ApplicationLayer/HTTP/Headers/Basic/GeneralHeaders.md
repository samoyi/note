# General headers
These are generic headers used by both clients and servers. They serve general
purposes that are useful for clients, servers, and other applications to supply
to one another. For example, the `Date` header is a general-purpose header that
allows both sides to indicate the time and date at which the message was
constructed:
```
Date: Tue, 3 Oct 1974 02:16:00 GMT
```
