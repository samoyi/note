# Response headers
Response messages have their own set of headers that provide information to the
client (e.g., what type of server the client is talking to). For example, the
following Server header tells the client that it is talking to a Version 1.0
Tiki-Hut server:
```
Server: Tiki-Hut/1.0
```
