# Entity headers
Entity headers refer to headers that deal with the entity body. For instance,
entity headers can tell the type of the data in the entity body. For example,
the following `Content-Type` header lets the application know that the data is
an HTML document in the iso-latin-1 character set:
```
Content-Type: text/html; charset=iso-latin-1
```
