## Preface
1. Uniform resource locators (URLs) are the standardized names for the Internet’s resources. URLs point to pieces of electronic information, telling you where they are located and how to interact with them.
2. In this chapter, we’ll cover:
    * URL syntax and what the various URL components mean and do
    * URL shortcuts that many web clients support, including relative URLs and expandomatic URLs
    * URL encoding and character rules
    * Common URL schemes that support a variety of Internet information systems
    * The future of URLs, including uniform resource names (URNs)—a framework to support objects that move from place to place while retaining stable names
