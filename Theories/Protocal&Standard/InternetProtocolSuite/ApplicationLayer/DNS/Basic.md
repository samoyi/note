## Basic



## Connect a DNS server
1. When a device connects to network, ISP assigns network address and some
important network configuration information to the device. That configuration
includes one or more DNS servers that the device should use when translating DNS
names to IP address.
2. This mechanism for assigning DNS servers to a devise is a part of
**Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)**, which dynamically distributes IP
 and other network configuration parameters.
3. If for some reasons, I don't want ISP assigning DNS servers for me, I can
choose and set my DNS servers manually.
